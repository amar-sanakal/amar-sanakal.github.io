I've been playing the game of Carrom since my childhood. Although I did play it during my school age, there was a gap of a few years
during college when I had lost touch with it. It was later during my post graduation that I had picked up playing his wonderful
game once again. I did manage to become the university champion during my time doing my masters in Mathematics at the Bombay University.
Again, I must admit I did lose touch with the game for some time, on and off, during the following years. 

It was much later, after having moved to the UK, and having played Carrom for a few years here that I finally made it into the UK team
playing the Euro Cup in 2015 in Switzerland. Moreover, even though I was playing in the UK team for the first time, we managed to win
the Team Championship once again for that year.

I must admit, I am quite happy with my [performance playing the game](http://sol3.arstecnica.it/lit/player/9e782b4c841711e3ac012e92809967e5)
over a period of time.
