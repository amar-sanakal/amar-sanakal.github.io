I first stumbled upon [Jiddu Krishnamurthy](http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/) as a teenager when I came across his book
[You are the World](http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/krishnamurti-teachings/view-text.php?s=books&tid=19&chid=68560).
After that I went on to read quite a few of his other books and I must admit that his teachings have had a major influence
on my outlook and over all world view.
