  <h1 class="page-heading">Hello World!</h1>

  <p class="welcome">On this plane of existence you'll probably know me as Amar Sanakal
   and if you don't, then you'll be advised that this is how you would address me. It does help in identifying
   one individual, viz. me, out of this large compendium of people abiding in this world. You might ask, and rightly so,
   why should you be interested in me?</p>
   <p>Oh, did I give you the impression that you must be interested in me? Sorry, that is not what I meant.
   All I really wanted to do was to setup my existence <strong>on the web</strong>. In doing so, I thought I could potentially take the
   opportunity to scratch my itch to pen down some random thoughts.</p>
   <p>I hope to do that in stages whenever I get the opportunity to add them to <a href="/blog">my blog</a>.</p>
