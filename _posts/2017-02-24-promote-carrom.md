Few months back, when I was involved with organising the [7th Carrom World Championship](http://worldchampionship.ukcarromfed.com),
I got a chance to talk about Carrom, reaching out to many in the UK. It was a part of a talk show hosted by [Channel S](http://www.chsuk.tv/)
and the experience has been quite unique and rewarding. Carrom is a game I love to play and talking about it was quite fun. I certainly enjoyed it.
You can check it all out on the below list of 3 videos on YouTube.

The 7th Carrom World Championship also got coverage from BBC when they reported the
[Carrom World Cahmpionship held in Birmingham](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-birmingham-37915719)
