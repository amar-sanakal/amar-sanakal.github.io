Upon being introduced by a friend, I had my first & unique opportunity of being interviewed on
[NuSound](http://nusoundradio.com/) radio by [RJ Ashwini](https://www.facebook.com/RJ-Ashwini-1653355808255740/).
It was, obviously, quite a novel experience talking on a live radio show. It was a short programme that RJ Ashwini
has introduced, called 'Local Londoners' wherein she interviews local common people. It was quite a privilege for me
to talk about my favourite game Carrom. I also got to talk about the upcoming
[7th Carrom World Championship](http://worldchampionship.ukcarromfed.com) being hosted in Birmingham in November 2016
by the [UK Carrom Federation](http://ukcarromfed.com/). 

I managed to record the interview on my Linux Mint laptop using `arecord`. You can listen to it [here](/media/NuSoundInterview.mp3).
For anyone interested in the technicalities, I'm going to put those details into a separate blog post.
