A couple of days ago I signed up to [terraform](https://www.terraform.io) but hadn't had a chance to try it out.
However, today I decided to give it a try with their [getting started guide](https://www.terraform.io/intro/getting-started/build.html). I was pleasantly
surprised and quite impressed with the ease of creating an AWS VM without the need to get my hands dirty with the the AWS CLI or even having to get onto
the console and clicking the forms to get an instance created. 

Defnitely worth exploring further. Go terraform, go!!
